    CSS Level 2 Revision 1 corrects errors in the 1998 Recommendation of CSS level 2 and adds a select few highly requested features originally planned for level 3, which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a ‘snapshot’ of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably for HTML and XML at the date of publication of the Recommendation.
